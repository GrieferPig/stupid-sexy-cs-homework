      Visual arts is a very large subject with many different fields of study
      such as ; painting, photography, filmmaking, pottery, basically anything
      that is appealing to the eye can be considered as visiual art. In
      addition, visual art is different from auditory art. Visual art mainly
      emphasizes people's visual feelings. Therefore, art forms such as film and
      television art that include both visual art and auditory art are usually
      classified into the category of comprehensive art forms.
